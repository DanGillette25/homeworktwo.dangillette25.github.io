This is my portfolio site (or what will be as soon as I have projects to speak of).  There are three HTML documents, a folder for images,
and a CSS Stylesheet that I used for some customizations not available in bootstrap.  The site functionality and styling also draws off 
of Bootstrap CSS, Bootstrap Javascript, and JQuery.

The portfolio page contains the projects I have worked on so far:

If you click on a project screenshot, a modal will pop up with a link to both the GitHub Repo it is on, as well as a link to the deployed application:
