This is my portfolio site (or what will be as soon as I have projects to speak of).  There are three HTML documents, a folder for images,
and a CSS Stylesheet that I used for some customizations not available in bootstrap.  The site functionality and styling also draws off 
of Bootstrap CSS, Bootstrap Javascript, and JQuery.
